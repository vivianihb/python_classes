# The ideia is to write a simple program that calculates the total pay for an employee based on the number of hours worked x the rate per hour.
# It also considers that the hours exceeding 40 will have a different rate.
# In this specific exercise, we were learning how to define functions.
# Again, rate should not be treated as a float, but rather as a currency, but it's a beginner's exercise.
